### Hi there, I'm Lauri ðŸ‘‹

I am a Product Marketing Manager at GoodData and a featured speaker at Product School with years of experience in different customer-facing and lead roles â€” from the startup scene to the global digital agency field â€” before turning to the world of technology, Software as a Service, and analytics.

### Iâ€™m currently: 
working on GoodDataâ€™s new cloud-native analytics platform â€” [GoodData Cloud Native](https://hub.docker.com/r/gooddata/gooddata-cn-ce) â€” an on-prem deployment to AWS, GCP, or Azure as containers (Docker & K8s).
